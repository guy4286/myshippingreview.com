<h2>My Story<br>
</h2>
<img src="images/thumbsDown.png" alt="">
<h3>A Long Story Short<br>
</h3>
<p> Their price guarantee "What u see is what u pay!" is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> true and they
will <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> back it up.&nbsp; I
was charged an unexpected $1,749.65 for a
customs inspection fee.  I reminded UPakWeShip about their price guarantee, but they
refused to honor it (see the emails on the right). <span style="font-weight: bold;">Update: I have recently been charged an <span style="font-style: italic;">additional</span> unexpected $2,600.00 in demurrage fees bringing the total unexpected fees to $4,349.65.</span><br>
</p>
<img src="images/shippingScandal5a.png" style="border: 1px solid; width: 418px; height: 121px;" alt="Price Guarantee X"><br>
<p>I originally signed a contract in which I agreed to pay $4,190.00 to move a
20ft container from California to London.</p>
<p>On the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">14th</span>
of December</span> my container
arrived and was loaded and departed for London.&nbsp; After returning
to London I received an email on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">19th</span>
of December</span> stating that my container was selected for a customs
exam and that there would be "additional costs".&nbsp; On the <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">30th</span>
of December</span> I was informed that the
"additional costs" for the customs exam would be $1,749.65.&nbsp; After
inquiring about the price guarantee I was told that "<span style="font-weight: bold;">there is no way we can guarantee these costs into our rates</span>".&nbsp; On the 13th of March, I received an <span style="font-style: italic;">additional</span> bill for $2,600.00 in demurrage fees bringing my total cost with fees included to <span style="font-weight: bold;">$8539.65</span>.</p>

<h2>Their Emails<br>
</h2>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/shippingScandal3.png" style="width: 421px; height: 250px;" alt="They don't guarantee their price.">
After a surprise fee I inquired about the price guarantee and received
the email above.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/shippingScandal4.png" style="width: 421px; height: 302px;" alt="If you don't pay quickly they'll charge you more.">
I was told if I didn't pay the fee quickly they would start
charging me additional fees. There was no backing out: if I wanted my
property back I would have to pay the unexpected fees.<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="images/extraChargesCashInPocket.png" style="width: 421px; height: 147px;" alt="Additional fees if cash isn't available.">
If you don't have the cash available to pay for the ridiculously large extra charges you'll face MORE fees!<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="newsletter"> <img src="images/skinhead.png" alt="">
<p>In summary, the price guarantee offered by UPakWeShip is not true
and you will probably have to pay substantial extra charges.<span></span>
